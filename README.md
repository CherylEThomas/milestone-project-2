![AmI.responsive design](/assets/readme-images/amiresponsive.jpg)

This game is designed to be used by primary school aged children who are learning to recognise alphabet letters.  It is intended to be fun yet simple challenge with a small amount of cards shuffling each time to ensure that the game is not too difficult for its intended user group.  

## User Experience (UX)
***

### User Stories

#### First Time Users Goals

* First time users should be able to easily navigate around the site and play the game with minimal adult assistance.
* First time visitors should be able to easily start a new game.

#### Returning Users Goals

* Returning users should be able to have a fresh game experience each time they play.
* Returning users should find new letters on the gameboard each time they play.


### Design

#### Colour Scheme

* The site uses a friendly and bright colour scheme to appeal to young players.

![Colour Palette](assets/readme-images/AlphabetPalette.png)

* The colour scheme was checked for colour contrast suitability using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to ensure that the chosen colours would be suitably accessible.

#### Typography

* The [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) fonts "Mochiy Pop One" and "Nunito" are the main fonts for the site.  Mochiy Pop One is a fun font intended to appeal to young users and Nunito is a simple, clear font which is easily read and understood.  Alternative sans serif alternatives can be loaded if these fonts cannot be utilised for any reason.  

#### Imagery

* Images for the card faces are taken from [Tulamama](https://tulamama.com/alphabet-flash-cards/) free to use flashcard downloads.
* The back card image is from a free image resource at [Wallpaperaccess](https://wallpaperaccess.com/confetti#google_vignette).

### Wireframes

Wireframes were produced using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to help form a visual guide of how I wanted the site to look once finished:

## Features
***

### Control Area
* The control area features buttons which allow the user to reset the game; a link to the help page and a score box.  These three controls remain fully visible on all size screens to make navigation easy for young users, however styling on a small screen requires some further development.  It is intended to further develop the controls to allow a JavaScript function to reset the game rather than reloading it fully.  

### Game grid
* The main game is set out as a grid of cards.  It is intended to keep the grid as a fixed size to ensure that the game is usable for younger children.  It is considered that having the game grid increase in size as the game progresses would make the game difficult for young players.  The intention of the game is in a learning capacity rather than as an increasingly difficult game.  

### Future Features
Additional features which could be included in the future include:
* Incorporation of more alphabet letters and corresponding pictures into the shuffled pack of cards.
* JavaScript code to enable an pop-up modal congratulating the player on winning and providing a button to start playing a new game.  Code for this feature has been started but could not be completed in time for submission at this point.
* An alternative game with cards showing numbers and pictures with a corresponding quantity of items.
* Provide additional Welsh language letter versions of the cards (i.e. letters dd, ll, ch) for bilingual users.
